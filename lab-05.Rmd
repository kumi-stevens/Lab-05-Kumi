# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_
#There are axis so it is hard to see the comparitive sizes of the groups.
#It is lacking information on what 'spoken language' means
#the parts with speech bubbles are different colours but have no meaning.
#but is fun


## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Write your comments about image 2 below_
#it  is quite confusing, as i am not sure what each variable is represented by, is the population the proportion of the whole, or the radius?



## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Write your comments about image 3 below_
#The visualisation is very confused, it is hard to tell what each point represents, what the size means or what the x-axis means?



## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Write your comments about image 4 below_
#very pretty, easy to see each country, but some of the data is obsrtucted/ it is not clear what for exapmle 'india' does after it disppears behing the others categories.




# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

#long format has every row as a unique case
#wide format has the observations as rows

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?


How many observations are there in the data set?

view(staff)
#there are 11 observations

## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1975","1989","1993","1995","1999","2001","2003","2005","2007","2009","2011"),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```
## Exercise 3





```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

# the problem here is htat each group only has one observation?
```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
#`````````


#```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Percentage of staff",
       title = "A graph to show how the percentage of staff employed in each faculty type has changed over time.")


```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* make only the part time faculty a colour
* group all other together
* 
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here



```
